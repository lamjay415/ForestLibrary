                <p className="p">Forest Library is a social network for everybody around the world who wants to create a good habit for their lives. 
                We believe a better life comes with a better habit so let's start by reading some book!

                <h1 className="title">A Sappling Once</h1>
                <p className="p">
                Here, you are a <span className="span-tree">tree</span> and you will start by adding a <span className="span-leaf">leaf</span> whenever you finish reading a book! 
                After your account is created, check your profile. You will notice your <span className="span-tree">tree</span> has no <span className="span-leaf">leaf</span>. 
                You can use the search bar to look for your book. <span className="span-example"> Ex: The Alchemist </span> Since you have found your book, click submit and voila! You have a <span className="span-leaf">leaf</span>!
                We encourage you to check the home page for other <span className="span-tree">trees</span> and read their <span className="span-leaf">leaves</span>. You may notice they have <span className="span-reviews">reviews</span>when you interact so why don't you go ahead and add yours now!
                On your profile click on the recent <span className="span-leaf">leaf</span> you just added. Go ahead and add what you think! <span className="span-example">Ex: Wow! What a book! I will commit myself to learn how to turn things into gold from now on. 5/5 </span>
                </p>
                <h1 className="title">Get Inspired</h1>
                <p className="p"> So you have finished your last book and trying to decide on your new journey, click <img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/16/898/898792.png" />  on the top right corner for some inspiration.
                 Or just play it along while you read your new favorite book!
